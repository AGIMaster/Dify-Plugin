# Privacy Policy for JustWait Plugin

## Introduction

The JustWait plugin is designed to provide simple waiting functionality in Dify workflows. This plugin does not collect, process, or store any personal data or user information.

**We do not collect any user data.** The JustWait plugin operates solely within your Dify environment and:

- Does not require authentication

## Functionality

The JustWait plugin simply implements waiting functionality similar to Python's `time.sleep()`. It performs two primary functions:

1. Wait for a specified number of seconds
2. Wait for a random amount of time within a specified range

No information is collected, transmitted, or stored during these operations.
